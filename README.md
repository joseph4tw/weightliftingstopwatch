## Why make this app?

Whenever I workout, I usually have a stopwatch going on my laptop. I wanted a way to keep track of my rest periods, so I figured I would write this app.

It's meant to be very simple with the following features:

- A single, always-running stop watch
- A countdown timer that you activate with a button - this timer is meant to time your rest period between sets.
