## Why make this app?

Whenever I workout, I usually have a stopwatch going on my laptop. I needed more functionality than what I found on the web, but I didn't want to make something complicated. All I need is a main timer, and a rest timer. This app does that, and it does it well.

It's meant to be very simple with the following features:
- A standard stop watch
- A countdown timer that you activate with a button - this timer is meant to time your rest period between sets.
